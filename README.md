# Generative AI Video Summarizer

Welcome to the **Generative AI Video Summarizer** project! This application leverages the power of the Gemini API and PhiData tools to generate detailed, user-friendly video summaries. Built using Streamlit, the tool provides an intuitive interface for uploading videos and analyzing their content using state-of-the-art generative AI models.

## Features

- **Video Upload**: Supports video files in formats like `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, and `.webm`.
- **Customizable Queries**: Users can specify questions or insights they seek from the video content.
- **Generative Analysis**: Uses Gemini and PhiData's multimodal capabilities to analyze video content and provide actionable summaries.
- **Supplementary Web Research**: Integrates DuckDuckGo for gathering additional context to enhance the video analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
